        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>As a cozy weeknight dinner or an addition to your 
            game day spread, chili is the comfort food staple 
            we can’t get enough of. We’ve created our fair 
            share of variations on the classic, but this white 
            chicken chili is one of our all-time favorites. 
            Adding white beans makes this heartier than your 
            average chicken noodle soup, and the addition of 
            green chiles, jalapeño, and sour cream add the 
            perfect amount of heat and creaminess to switch up 
            classic chili. Plus, everything comes together in 
            less than an hour, making it an easy, no-stress 
            dinner to cozy up to any time of year.</p>

            <li>5 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 (4.5-oz.) cans green chiles Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 c. frozen corn</li>
            <li>1/2 c. sour cream</li>
            <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced, for serving</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. 
                Add onion and jalapeño and cook, stirring, 
                until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, 
                oregano, and cumin and cook, stirring, until 
                fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken, broth, 
                and chiles; season with salt and pepper. Bring 
                to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, 
                uncovered, until chicken is tender and cooked 
                through, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer chicken to 
                a plate and shred with 2 forks.
            </li>
            <li>Set the soften peppers into a lightly oiled
                baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>Add beans to pot and bring to a simmer. Cook, 
                smashing about one-quarter of beans with a 
                wooden spoon, until slightly thickened, about 
                10 minutes. Add corn and shredded chicken and 
                cook, stirring, until heated through, about 1 
                minute more. Remove from heat and stir in sour 
                cream.
            </li>
            <li>Ladle chili into bowls. Top with avocado, 
                cilantro, chips, and cheese.
            </li>
        </ol>

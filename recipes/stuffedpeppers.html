        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Blanch the bell peppers for 5 minutes to
                slightly soften.
            </li>
            <li>Set the soften peppers into a lightly oiled
                baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pan to medium heat
                and add the onions, chopped pepper tops, and
                jalapeno. Cook for 5 minutes to soften.
            </li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook 1 minute, or until
                the garlic becomes fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>Add the ground meat and cook for 5-6 minutes,
                breaking apart as you go, until cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Add the fire roasted tomatoes, seasonings, and
                cooked rice mixture. Stir together and remove
                heat.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese until
                incorportated. You can add in a bit more if
                you'd like it more cheesy.
            </li>
            <li>Stuff each pepper with the meat filling mixture,
                then top each with the remaining shredded 
                cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Roast the stuffed peppers for 15-20 minutes,
                or until the peppers are tender to your 
                preference, and the cheese is nice and bubbly.
                So good topped with cheese! this is a pretty
                forgiving recipe, so you can usually bake them
                longer if you want the peppers extra softened 
                up.
            </li>
            <li>Cool slightly, garnish, and serve.</li>
        </ol>

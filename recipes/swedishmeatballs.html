        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>You can try these fantastic Swedish Meatballs, or 
            Köttbullar as they call it, in every Ikea 
            restaurant worldwide. We never ate them there, 
            but we adore them nonetheless. So much so that we 
            even wrote a version of the recipe in our cookbook 
            Epic 30-Minute Roasts. These small, bite-sized 
            balls are made with ground beef (either beef or a 
            mixture of beef and pork), bread, onion, garlic, 
            and spices. In this recipe, we use spices like 
            cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, to create warm 
            flavors. This is the perfect family meal for all 
            seasons.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>50 g (1 thick slice) white bread, 
                crust removed</li>
            <li>80 g (1/3 cup) warm milk</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>1 tbsp parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp BAM Spices Arabic Coffee Mixture 
                (or a mixture of nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon)</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>600 g (1.4 pounds) ground beef</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly coarse</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>40 g (3 tbsp) butter</li>
            <li>30 g (3 tbsp) flour</li>
            <li>750 ml (3 cups) beef broth or water</li>
            <li>60 g (1/4 cup) whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh parsley or dill, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place a rack in the middle of the oven and 
                preheat the fan-assisted oven to 
                220 °C / 430 °F or a conventional oven to 
                230 °C / 445 °F. Line a large baking sheet 
                with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine bread cut into small pieces, 
                warm milk, diced onion, garlic, and chopped 
                parsley. Season with BAM Spices Arabic Coffee 
                Mixture (or 1 tsp homemade mixture made of 
                ground nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves). Add an 
                egg and stir well with a spatula.
            </li>
            <li>Add the meat and the bread mixture to a large 
                bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Knead into 
                a smooth mixture and shape into 36 small 
                meatballs, approximately 3 cm or 1-inch in 
                diameter. Arrange the meatballs on the 
                prepared baking sheet and drizzle with olive 
                oil. Place in the oven and roast for 12 
                minutes at 220 °C / 430 °F (fan-assisted oven) 
                or at 230 °C / 445 °F in a conventional oven.
            </li>
            <li>Make the sauce. Place a large pan on 
                medium-high heat. Add the butter. When it 
                melts, add the flour and stir well with a 
                spoon. Cook for 5 - 8 minutes or until the 
                flour is golden-brown. Be careful not to burn 
                it. While whisking continuously with a whisk, 
                pour the beef broth to get a smooth sauce. 
                Bring to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes. Add 
                the whipping cream and season with salt and 
                pepper. Add the baked meatballs and simmer for 
                another 6 - 8 minutes. Serve with chopped 
                parsley and dill.
